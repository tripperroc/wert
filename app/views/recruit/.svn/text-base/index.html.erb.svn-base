<p>
  Thank you for completing our survey. We have one last favor to ask of you, for which 
  we will pay you up to $15. It would be helpful for us if you could help us find 
  other people to take the survey. To be eligible, the person must be a Facebook 
  friend, at least 18 years old, male, and gay. Invite three of your Facebook friends:
</p>

<p>
  <span>Invitation #1</span>
  <span class="fb-send" data-href="<%= url_for :controller => 'recruit', :action => 'invitation', :only_path => false %>"></span>
</p>

<p>
  <span>Invitation #2</span>
  <span class="fb-send" data-href="<%= url_for :controller => 'recruit', :action => 'invitation', :only_path => false %>"></span>
</p>

<p>
  <span>Invitation #3</span>
  <span class="fb-send" data-href="<%= url_for :controller => 'recruit', :action => 'invitation', :only_path => false %>"></span>
</p>

<p>
  We will give you $5 in Amazon.com credit for each of the first three friends of yours who 
  takes the survey.  You may recruit friends any way you see fit. You may click here 
  to send the person a Facebook message, however we have found that more direct 
  approaches (such as a personal email or text message) works better.

</p>

<p> Here is your recruitment URL. Give this to any Facebook friend who
  is eligible to take the survey.
</p>
<p>
<a href ="<%= @invitation_url %>"><%=@invitation_url %></a>
</p>
<p>
  Here is a sample email message. You may use it as is, but messages that are 
  directly tailored toward the recipient tend to be more effective.

    You will earn $10 in Amazon credit just for taking the survey and will 
    help the medical and public policy communities better understand of the 
    health concerns of gay men. Additionally, I will earn $5 for referring 
    you. After taking the survey, you may also have the opportunity to earn 
    additional credit by referring others to the survey. Thank you!
