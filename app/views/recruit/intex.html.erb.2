 Thank you for completing the survey! You have now earned $5. Would you be willing to help us find 
  other adult gay male friends to take the survey? 
</p>

  <a href="#" id = "fb-invite">Recruit friends through Facebook</a>

</p>

<p>
  We will give you $5 in Amazon.com credit for each of your first three friends who 
  take the survey.  We have found that more direct 
  approaches, such as a personal email or text message, work better
  than going through Facebook. Here is a sample email you may use,
  however it is only necessary to provide the link below.

    Dear Friend,
  </p>

  <p>
    I just took a online survey on gay menâ€™s health and wanted to invite you to take it as well. 
    If you are interested, please copy the link below into your web browser.
  </p>
 <p>
<a href ="<%= @invitation_url %>"><%=@invitation_url %></a>
</p>
<p>
 <p>
    You will earn $5 in Amazon credit just for taking the survey and will 
    help the medical and public policy communities better understand of the 
    health concerns of gay men. Additionally, I will earn $5 for referring 
    you. After taking the survey, you may also have the opportunity to earn 
    additional credit by referring others to the survey. Thank you!
  </p>
