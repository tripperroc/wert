      <b>Title of Study:</b> Social Diffusion in Online Media for Reaching Hidden
      Communities and Underrepresented Groups
      <br />
      <b>Principal Investigator:</b> Vincent Silenzio, M.D., M.P.H.

      <b>University of Rochester Department:</b> Psychiatry
    </p>

    <p>
      <b><u>Introduction:</u></b> This letter describes a research study that
      researchers from the University of Rochester are conducting along with
      our research partners from the Rochester Institute of Technology, and 
      Drexel University. This study is intended to show that online social 
      networks such as Facebook can be used to assess health. We estimate that 
      approximately 1500 people will take part in this study. You will be 
      asked to complete a brief survey. This should take up to five minutes. 
      At the end of the survey, you will have the chance to ask up to three 
      of your friends who you think would be eligible and willing to participate.
    </p>

    <p>
      <b><u>Payment:</u></b> You will receive $5 in online credit at Amazon.com
      for completing the survey. You can also earn more Amazon.com credit when 
      you refer friends who complete the survey. You can refer up to three 
      Facebook friends. For each one who completes the survey, you will receive 
      an additional $5 in Amazon.com credit, up to a total of $20. When added 
      to the $5 credit you receive for finishing your own survey, you may 
      receive an overall total of between $5 and $20 in credit you can use 
      as you please at the Amazon.com store.
    </p>

    <p>
      <b>Your participation in this survey is completely voluntary.</b> 
      You are free not to participate or to withdraw at any time, for whatever 
      reason without penalty.
    </p>

    <p>
      <b><u>Privacy:</u></b> All the information we receive from you, including 
      your name and any other identifying information, will be strictly 
      confidential. In order to protect your privacy, your individual responses 
      will not be shared with anyone. Only summarized data that is pooledfrom 
      all participants will be presented at meetings or in any publications. 
      Information regarding your personal identity will not be used, nor would 
      any information be shared that would make it possible for anyone to 
      identify you or your responses.
    </p>

    <p>
      We are using a secure online connection to minimize any risk to your 
      privacy from un-authorized parties (e.g. computer hackers). While we 
      are taking steps to prevent it from occurring, you should be aware 
      that there is a small possibility that responses could be viewed by 
      unauthorized parties because your responses are being communicated 
      over the web and stored on a web server. There are no other expected 
      risks to you for helping with this study. There are also no expected 
      benefits for you.
    </p>

    <p>
      We will keep what we learn about you private, but we may have to share 
      this information with University of Rochester monitors or the Department 
      of Health and Human Services. While they normally protect the privacy 
      of this information, they may not be required to do so by law. Results 
      of the research may be presented at meetings or in publications, but 
      your name will not be used.
    </p>

    <p>
      By law, we have to get your authorization to use health information we 
      collect from you. We will use your responses to the survey questions, 
      including your age range, gender, and sexual orientation, to conduct 
      the study. This information may be audited to make sure we are following 
      regulations, policies and study plans.
    </p>

    <p>
      Your Authorization for this study will not expire unless you tell us 
      you want to cancel it.  We will keep your responses to the survey 
      questions indefinitely. However your name and other personal 
      information will be discarded as soon as possible after the conclusion 
      of the study, once all participants have received payment. If you 
      cancel your Authorization, you will be removed from the study.
