<p>
  Thank you for completing our survey. We have one last favor to ask you, for which
  we will pay you up to $15. It would be a great help for us if you could help us 
  find other people to take the survey. To be eligible, the person must be a Facebook 
  friend, at least 18, male, and gay. Invite three of your Facebook friends:
</p>

<p>
  <span>Invitation #1</span>
  <span class="fb-send" data-href="<%= url_for :controller => 'recruit', :action => 'invitation', :only_path => false %>"></span>
</p>

<p>
  <span>Invitation #2</span>
  <span class="fb-send" data-href="<%= url_for :controller => 'recruit', :action => 'invitation', :only_path => false %>"></span>
</p>

<p>
  <span>Invitation #3</span>
  <span class="fb-send" data-href="<%= url_for :controller => 'recruit', :action => 'invitation', :only_path => false %>"></span>
</p>

<p>
  We will give you $5 in Amazon.com credit for the first three friends of yours who 
  takes the survey.  You may recruit friends anyway you see fit. You may click here 
  to send the person a facebook message, however, we have found that more direct 
  approaches (such as a personal email or text message) works better.
